          <p>
            Hey there, my name is Myriam Boisselle. I have 9 years of experience
            in the field sound mixing and recording. I was born in Mexico and
            raised in Florida. I have worked in several US states as well as
            Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia on an array of productions. I am all
            ears to understanding your workflow as it relates to your data
            handling, sensitivity, time frame and hardware requirements. My
            first priority is to be on the same page, thereby flowing and
            accomplishing efficiently, I do this by keeping you in sync with
            clean dialogue, riding the waves of creation and morphing from a
            small footprint ENG package to a more rich sound package for
            Production Sound needs. Whether you are documenting stories that
            need a voice, co-creating inspirations, or bringing musings, dreams
            and missions to life, I’m here. ​ Throughout my on location sound
            jobs, I've also become skilled in post-production as a dialogue
            editor, video editor, and M&E track sound designer (including foley
            creation). I'm happy to say that knowing the end goal prepared me to
            be a more conscious Sound Mixer.
